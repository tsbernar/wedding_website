  Please know that your presence at our wedding is present enough! <br> However, if you feel so compelled, in lieu of a traditional registry, we'd be grateful for a gift to the Heifer Project in our honor. One of the ways that The Heifer Project works to support sustainable agriculture and economic development, is by providing would-be independent farmers with the animals to get them started, buy them some goats in our name!
